This program allows users to input a stock symbol of interest and displays the most recent stock prices along with a historical stock price trend chart.

Users simply need to enter the stock symbol, and the program will automatically fetch the relevant data from a financial database.

It will then display the recent stock prices in a tabular format and generate a chart showing the stock's historical performance, 

helping users quickly understand the stock's price history.
